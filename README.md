# Tiny-language-parser
Desktop application of a Tiny parser with recursive descent method using Python and pyqt5.

## Notes
* Parsing is the task of determining the syntax, or structure, of a program. It is called syntax analysis.
* In TINY there are two basic kinds of structures: statements and expressions.
* There are five kinds of statements (if-statements, repeat-statements, assign-statements, read-statements, and write-statements) and three kinds of expressions (operator-expression, constant expressions, and identifier expressions).
